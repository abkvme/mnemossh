# Code of Conduct

## 1. Be decent
Treat others with respect. No harassment, insults, or discrimination of any kind. Assume good intentions but don’t test people’s patience.

## 2. Keep it constructive
Discuss ideas, not people. Help improve code, docs, and design without being condescending.

## 3. Stay relevant
Use project spaces for project matters. Spam, trolling, or unrelated content isn’t welcome.

## 4. Enforcement
Maintainers may edit, hide, or remove anything that breaks these rules, and restrict participation if needed.

## 5. Spirit
This project is built on voluntary effort and trust. Don’t ruin it for everyone else.
